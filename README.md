# README

Hey there. This is a project I set up to let users browse youtube videos of artists recorded for the John Peel show that run on BBC radio from 1968 to 2004. Peel's show was a launchpad for many bands on their way to stardom who recored studio sessions specially for the show

Credit due to davestrickson who put out a huge listing of sessions featured on youtube on his blog davestrickson.blogspot.com
